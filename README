Win32::PrintBox - Redirects print STDOUT and warn statements to a message box under wperl

Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    use Win32::PrintBox;
    
    print "Program output\n";
    warn "I am here\n";

This module makes a perl script act like a windows application when started with
wperl.exe, using message boxes. It has no effect when scripts are executed from a shell.

For perl (not wperl) scripts started from Explorer, or any other windows application, a
final "Press any key to continue" is added, to allowing the user to see all output before
the console window closes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
